# OBS SCRIPTS

This repository contains some various OBS scripts that I find useful.

Scripts can be loaded into OBS via the Tools > Scripts menu.

## Scripts

1. [ResetAudioMonitors](https://github.com/jakubbilko/obs-scripts/blob/main/ResetAudioMonitors.lua)

Reset the audio monitor settings for your sources with one button! Useful is your obs glitches out and you have to manually reset your audio monitor settings.

## Support

If you like what I do and you're feeling generous, support me on Ko-Fi.
